    img: maize,
    content: [
      'El-kanis, as a key stakeholder in sustainable food and agriculture systems, has taken significant strides in empowering 10,000 smallholder farmers in Cross River State and Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Through the SAPRUL (Sustainable Agricultural Program for Rural Livelihoods) project, El-kanis has been at the forefront of knowledge sharing and capacity development initiatives. El-kanis recognized the importance of including all stakeholders, including youth, rural women, men, and their cooperatives, as full partners in problem identification, research, and advisory services. This participatory approach fostered a sense of ownership and empowerment among the farmers and rural dwellers.',
      "One of the key components of the project was the establishment of pluralistic extension systems involving multiple actors, such as the public sector, private agents, civil society organizations, and non-governmental organizations. El-kanis collaborated with these entities, ensuring that knowledge was delivered to the farmers based on each organization's expertise. This collaborative effort enriched the training programs, covering a wide range of topics essential for sustainable farming practices.",
      '<h3>Farmer-Centric Training Programs</h3>',
      'El-kanis, in collaboration with local partners and farmer organizations, designed comprehensive training programs for rice and maize farmers. These farmer-centric programs focus on enhancing technical knowledge, promoting sustainable practices, and improving farm management skills. Smallholder rice and maize farmers benefited from practical farm management skills, including crop planning, soil health management, water efficiency, pest and disease control, post-harvest handling, financial management, market access, and climate-smart practices. Equipping farmers with these skills enhances productivity, reduces losses, and improves their overall livelihoods. Knowledge of farm mechanization, entrepreneurship, and value addition allows farmers to explore new opportunities and ensure sustainable growth in the agricultural sector.',
      "Take the case of Chief Damian Egbata, a rice farmer from Ekureku, Cross River State. Through El-kanis' farmer field schools, he learned about innovative practices such as System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and improved water management. System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a sustainable rice cultivation method that emphasizes transplanting young seedlings, wider spacing, reduced water usage, and organic matter incorporation. SRI offers benefits such as higher yields, water efficiency, reduced input costs, climate resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This innovative approach promotes sustainable agricultural practices and contributes to food security and environmental protection. Armed with this knowledge, Chief Damian increased his rice yield significantly, witnessing a 30% rise in productivity compared to previous years.",
      '<h3>Market-Oriented Approach</h3>',
      'El-kanis recognizes the importance of connecting farmers to modern value chains. The training programs emphasize business-oriented approaches, imparting skills not only in production but also in post-harvest handling, storage, and marketing. By understanding market demands and quality standards, smallholder farmers are better equipped to produce rice and maize that meet market requirements.',
      "Mrs Grace Uche, a maize farmer from Ebonyi State, underwent training on value chain management. El-kanis helped her establish links with Spertant Processing Mill Nigeria Limited, a livestock feed producer who required high-quality maize. As a result, Grace's maize yield improved, and she now supplies her produce to Spertant processing mills, contributing to the company's value chain while securing a stable market for her produce.",
      '<h3>Social Inclusiveness and Gender Sensitivity</h3>',
      'El-kanis places great emphasis on engaging women and youth in the training programs. The company ensures that women farmers actively participate in decision-making and capacity-building initiatives. Moreover, youth are provided with opportunities to explore sustainable socio-economic entrepreneurship in agriculture and related industries.',
      "Miss Mary Okon, a young farmer from Cross River State, benefited from El-kanis' training on sustainable entrepreneurship. With the company's support, she started a small agribusiness, processing maize into various products. Not only did this create new employment opportunities for other youth in the community, but it also generated a steady supply of raw materials for El-kanis' processing mills.",
      "El-kanis' commitment to building the capacity and knowledge of 10,000 rice and maize farmers in Cross River State and Ebonyi State through the SAPRUL project has yielded remarkable results. The shift towards farmer-driven, market-oriented approaches has empowered smallholders to thrive in the agricultural sector. Through training programs, farmers have increased their yields, enhanced product quality, and successfully integrated into modern value chains. Furthermore, El-kanis' focus on social inclusiveness has paved the way for women and youth to actively participate in sustainable agricultural practices and entrepreneurship. El-kanis' initiatives have not only transformed the livelihoods of smallholder farmers but have also contributed to the development of greener and more resilient food systems in the region.",

      'Malnutrition is common in Nigeria. It most times results to health effects that range from mild to severe, and sometimes life-threatening. The most common malnutrition include deficiencies in vitamin A, iron and zinc with prevalence of 29.5%, 26%, and 20% respectively in children under five years.',
      'Commonly used interventions include nutrient supplementation, dietary diversification, commercial fortification, nutritional education and agricultural interventions. Some of these programmes are expensive with short term benefits. Biofortification of staples has been identified as a cost effective, sustainable means of delivery of nutrition to the population. Biofortified crops formally released in Nigeria are provitamin A cassava, orange flesh sweet potato and yellow maize as well as quality protein maize.',
      'The underlying causes of malnutrition in Nigeria are poverty, inadequate food production, and inadequate food intake. There is a close nexus between malnutrition and poverty. “One of the consequences of poverty,” said, Dr Blessing Akombi-Inyang, a lecturer in Global Public Health at the University of South Wales, “is the lack of access to nutritious food, which predisposes people to poor nutrition. Poverty increases the chances of malnutrition. Malnutrition, in turn, traps communities in poverty. Poverty and malnutrition are inextricably linked.',
      'A well-diversified diet is nature’s own way of meeting the micronutrient needs of a population. However this might be currently unattainable in most households due to poverty and lack of education. Some farmers’ families sell their micronutrient rich harvested fruits and vegetables to buy cheaper staples.',
      'Whilst Nigeria is the biggest global producer of cassava, at 60 mt in 2017, just 2.8% is biofortified. Switching to newly released biofortified varieties of cassava could provide up to 40% of the Vitamin A recommended daily allowance for children under five, in a country where nearly one in three children under five and one-quarter of all pregnant women are Vitamin A deficient. Lack of sufficient vitamin A blinds up to 500,000 children annually and increases the risk of death from disease (such as diarrhea in children). Vitamin A deficiency is widely prevalent in Nigeria.',
      'Foods that are good sources of vitamin A, such as orange fruits, dark leafy vegetables, or meat, are not always available, or may be too expensive in some states. In many States, people eat large amounts of staple foods like cassava or maize. For example, in Akwa Ibom, people eat up to a pound of white garri daily. However, this white garri provides no beta-carotene. Switching to vitamin A cassava, which is rich in beta-carotene, could potentially provide cassava-dependent populations with up to half their daily vitamin A needs.',
      'As part of our effort to minimize micronutrient deficiency, El-kanis and Partners has cultivated orange fleshed sweet potato on over 50 hectares to supply government school feeding programme and is also collaborating with non-governmental agencies such as get Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and HarvestPlus to strengthen Vitamin A Maize and Vitamin A cassava value chain through training, input supply, technical support and market access. It is projected that biofortification of local staples will provide at least 30% of estimated average requirements (EAR) for iron, 25% for zinc and 50% for provitamin A.',

Part of VGF should be channeled to support farmers grow nutrition-sensitive agriculture in Nigeria. El-kanis and Partners is already implementing nutrition-sensitive agricultural projects in several parts of Nigeria and are open to partnership for scale.',
      'Nutrition-sensitive agriculture is a food-based approach to agricultural development that puts nutritionally rich foods and dietary diversity at the heart of overcoming under-nutrition, over-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. The primary objective of investing in nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems is to ensure that acceptable, diverse, nutritious and safe foods, adequate to meet the dietary needs of people of all ages, are available and affordable at all times.',
      'This can mean, for example, introducing good practices that enable year-round access to a variety of nutritious food – either by making sure producers have the resources to produce the right foods for a healthy diet, or by equipping markets to sell a variety of nutritious foods at affordable prices. It also means preventing food loss and waste by reducing food-borne pathogens through good hygiene practices and improving technology along the value chain. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture also means educating families about nutrition so they can produce, purchase, prepare and consume healthy foods.',
      '<b>2. Stimulate downstream demand</b>',
      'Urban and rural consumer groups have all demonstrated in-principle willingness to pay for Vitamin A cassava, as high as a 31% price premium for Vitamin A garri when aware of benefits. These groups represent more than 60% of the market (46.8% consuming gari and 14.4% fufu), but the majority are not yet aware of Vitamin A cassava’s nutritional benefits. Stimulating market demand through awareness campaigns will encourage upscale by strategic enterprises and opportunistic smallholders, as uncertainty about market demand will be removed for micro-processors and SMEs.',
      '<b>3. Reinforce linkages between stem producers and small farmers</b>',
      'Once demand is proven, sustained production of Vitamin A cassava, orange flesh sweet potato and vitamin A maize could be addressed through improved linkages between stem producers and farmers as this affects the whole value chain. The demand of basic gari, fufu, custard and other biofortified food products are mainly serviced by smallholder farmers, who get their seeds from large farms undertaking multiplication. As such, the weak linkages between the International agencies, partners, smallholders and the large farms who supply their seeds will need to be strengthened. There are a number of ways development agencies and government can support these value chain linkages, including:',
      'a). Outreach: Supporting farmer outreach to broaden connections between smallholder farmers, agro dealers and stem producers through marketing and information campaigns. This would require a short-term investment and would need to be backed by seed availability.',
      'b). Extension Services: Reinforcing government networks of extension services and demonstration plots is another avenue to connect farmers to services. However, the limited use and effectiveness of these services in Nigeria may restrict the efficacy of this approach.',
      'c). Clustering: Facilitating clustering of smallholder farmers in associations or cooperatives in order to create direct links between cooperatives and processors. The high fragmentation of both smallholder farmers and microprocessors makes this both a potentially high impact and challenging approach We believe that the most effective intervention would be outreach to farmers in order to establish seed links, and clustering of farmers to facilitate downstream linkages to processors. Much of this has already been conducted by HarvestPlus programmes, hence we would recommend the scale-up of these activities into areas beyond south west of Nigeria.',

      'A leading indigenous Agricultural firm, El-kanis and Partners that are into food production and agricultural support service is ready and prepared to contend this monstrous food scarcity which is imminently threatening the livelihoods of over 100 million Nigerians.',
      'To curb food insecurity in Nigeria, El-kanis and Partners have commenced cultivation of Rice, cassava, maize the 3 major staple foods in Nigeria. Leveraging on several factors to bridge the hunger gap such as availability of nutrient enriched land and host community support, El-kanis will be cultivating over 7,000h of arable land to feed local mills and local foodstuff markets.',
      'As indicators for the likelihood in the food crises deepen, it is imperative for citizens to heed this warning and begin an aggressive plan of going into full scale farming to ameliorate the crises which looms.',
      'Other measures that could curb food crises include elevating the value of women in society and providing them with the education and resources they need to manage their farms, their families and their health. Nigeria should create conditions that will allow women to grow more food, feed a greater number of people and share their knowledge with others. El-kanis in partnership with West Africa Trade and Investments Hub and USAID are co-investing to support over 4,000 women farmers who will cultivate rice and maize.',
      'Also, providing resources directly to farmers is one of the fastest ways to improve their conditions and crop yields, as well as the health and nutrition of their families and communities. And providing resources to farmers doesn’t just help build individual and community food security — it can help alleviate poverty, too, since extreme poverty and hunger has a cyclical relationship.',
      'Hungry people have a hard time working, and people who can’t work have a hard time affording food. Nigeria needs to prioritise agriculture as an economic and security agenda. Nigerian leaders must prioritise investment in agriculture and food systems, not only as an economic agenda, but as a security agenda. Investment in agriculture has been found to be 11 times more effective in reducing poverty than any other sectors in Nigeria.',
      'Additionally, if Nigeria prioritises investment in youth, it could reap additional US$500 billion in return to its economy every year.',
      'Making agriculture profitable and attractive to young people and involving young people in the planning, design, and implementation of agricultural policies could also curb rising food cost.',
      'El-kanis has observed low involvement of youth in policy dialogues, budget consultation process, and programme implementation. As a result, policies often fail to provide them with adequate support that aligns with their aspirations. To attract young people into the sector, government spending must be targeted at reducing real and perceived agribusiness risks, enable financing, and improve infrastructure. Currently, high lending rates are stunting the growth of small and medium scale agribusinesses. Rural agribusinesses can thrive when they have access to finances and are well connected to local communities and markets.',
      'Nigerian leaders must take leadership and prioritise the implementation of Malabo commitments on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihood. The Biennial Review (BR) scorecard is an important tool for learning and monitoring our collective progress. Often times, several policies are developed, but not fully implemented. For Nigeria to make significant progress, each state must report its progress and respond swiftly to its policy formulation and implementation gaps.',
      'Nigeria now has the tools to reach SDG 2’s goal of zero hunger by 2030: our youth and arable land. However, our leaders must prioritise the three steps in order for Nigeria to be well on the way to tackling food insecurity, while also creating jobs for our teeming youth.',
      'In addition, The African Development Bank ( AfDB) has designed a $1.5 billion emergency food production plan for Nigeria and Africa. The African Development Bank’s emergency food plan is currently before the Bank’s Board of Directors for approval. It is set for implementation. AfDB also noted that Africa now faces a shortage of at least 30 million metric tons of food, especially for wheat, maize, and soybeans imported from both countries.',
      'African Development Bank has designed a $1.5 billion Africa Emergency Food Production Plan to support countries to rapidly-produce around 38 million tonnes of food to mitigate the effect of the war on food prices. This will include 11 million tonnes of wheat; 18 million tonnes of maize; 6 million tonnes of rice; and 2.5 million tonnes of soybean. Nigeria is a top priority under the emergency food production plan, Adesina said, adding that the strategy will help the country produce 9.5 million tonnes of food.',
      'The initiative will support the country’s 5 million smallholder farmers during the wet season of 2022 and 1 million across 10 Northern states during the dry season of 2022/2023.',

    img: vac,
    content: [
      'As part of the overall effort to minimize micronutrient deficiency in Nigeria, a leading Agribusiness service, El-kanis and Partners has designed and developed brochure aimed at providing food producers and manufacturers with knowledge on how to procure, store, process, sell and market Vitamin A Maize (VAM) and Vitamin A Cassava (VAC) food products.',
      'The project, sponsored by HarvestPlus and Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) through the Commercialization of Biofortified Crops (CBC) project is targeted at  providing food producers and manufacturers with knowledge on how to procure, store, process, sell and market VAM and VAC food products.',
      'Speaking during the stakeholders review session, the Managing Director El-kanis and Partners, Mr. Ben Ukpe noted that the main objective of the brochure is to establish the current regulatory frameworks and food industry guidelines on the marketing of VAC and VAM ingredients.',
      'El-kanis provided HarvestPlus and GAIN with the expertise to develop, implement, and maintain modern food safety management systems based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system principles.',
      '“This is to create guideline documents for businesses involved in production, processing and marketing of VAC and VAM, which we have also identified authorities involved in the creation and endorsement of new standards and regulations in Nigeria.” Ukpe said.',
      'Mr. Ukpe decried a situation where most consumers make purchases without taking note of this information perhaps because they do not understand the information provided due to the complexity of the data.',
      'He revealed that as at the time of developing the document, Nigeria had no laws regulating products of Vitamin A cassava and Vitamin A Maize and also acknowledged draft biosafety bill  before the National Assembly for consideration.',
      '“The draft bill advocates compulsory labeling of food items containing products of biotechnology to protect consumers’ right to know. When the bill is passed, NAFDAC will be the enforcing agency.” Mr. Ukpe said.',
      'On the purpose of the brochure, the MD of El-kanis and Partners said it will ensure that VAC/VAM food labeling and marketing is effective in Nigeria, provide food processors and producers with means for conveying information of the nutrient content of enriched foods on the label; encourage the use of sound nutrition principles in the formulation of VAC/VAM foods which would benefit public health as well as provide opportunity to include VAC/VAM nutrition information on the label.',
      'He also explained that the brochure will ensure that Vitamin A Maize (VAM),Vitamin A Cassava (VAC) VAC/VAM food labeling does not describe a product or present information about it that is in any way false, misleading, deceptive, or insignificant in any manner and to ensure that no nutrition claim is made without nutrition labelling.',
      'In his response, president Consumer Advocacy for Food Safety and Nutrition Initiative(CAFSANI) , Professor Olugbenga Ogunmoyela commended the brochure and enjoined processors to explore the rich content of the brochure.',
      'He also asked HarvestPlus to make the hardcopy available at ADP and CBC desk offices for easy accessibility.',
      'Speaking, Goodluck Ogu, Country Manager, Commercialization of Biofortified Crops Program noted that to assist  consumers put Vitamin A cassava and Vitamin A Maize information into consideration in their purchase, prior knowledge is required, adding that such knowledge could enhance implementation of the understood and remembered information in making a food choice.',
      '“One way through which this information can be accessed is food labeling. This can assist in curbing health risks by helping people make better food purchase decisions and adopt healthier eating patterns.” Mr. Ogu said.',
      'In her presentation, Jenny Walton, Demand Creation, HarvestPlus Washington revealed that information about nutrients enriched foods will ensures that the health information gap between nutrients enriched food producers and nutrients enriched food consumers is bridged which she said will further enable consumers make well-informed eating choices.',
      'Meanwhile, the brochure developed by El-kanis and Partners has different labeling and information strategies employed to enhance better food purchasing choices.',
      'The brochure includes provision of nutrient content information using either back-of-pack product labels or diagrams to indicate important nutrients and enumeration of ingredients and its quantities on restaurant menus.',
      'El-kanis food safety and development programmes has provided high-quality professional services to help more than 20 companies including Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMSE) apply national food safety standards and adapt sustainable business models, in which one of the businesses received 2020 National SMSE Award from the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. EL-kanis programs include food safety assessments, outgrower projects, agribusiness training and input supplies.',
      'El-kanis worked with Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,NUJ, Tertiary institutions, NAFDAC and other sister regulatory agencies during the development of the brochure.',

    img: veg,
    content: [
      'The three day free training on Vegetable Farming with an objective to build the capacity of vegetable farmers and intending farmers was completed on Friday, 1st April 2022. The aim is to improve the livelihoods of low-income vegetable and fruit farmers in Akwa Ibom State. The project targets the horticulture subsector (vegetables and fruits), which is particularly relevant to women farmers. The importance of training women farmers cannot be over-emphasized.',
      'A total of 48 participants participated in this training. Women generally have been in the forefront of the fight against food crisis in the entire world. In Africa and Nigeria in particular, women produce about 78 percent of the continent’s food, vegetables including meat from livestock on subsistence and small land holdings with very limited access to training and other production resources Rural women are engaged in a wide range of farming activities and are responsible in most cases for food production, processing, distribution, home consumption and for sale. Women now make up the majority of the agricultural sector in Nigeria, but recent evidence suggests that their productivity is constrained by lack of appropriate training skills.',
      'The purpose of this training was to train participants on Good Agronomic Practice and its role in the viable vegetable production and also provide information for those intending to start Backyard vegetable farm. Training included various topics such Pest/disease control method, Fertilizers selection and application rate, Storage methods & procedures , Harvesting time & techniques, Nursery operations, Planting and Transplanting operations, Chemical weed control, Compost manure preparation, Land Management, Agric-support services and Irrigation methods.',
      'The local demand for vegetables is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. Two major trends will bring this about - rising per capita income and continuing population growth in the Nigeria. Vegetables supply vitamins, minerals, fibers, and supplementary amounts of protein and calories essential to the human diet. If the urban and rural poor in Nigeria were to have access to vegetables, there should be adequate and stable supplies to keep their prices affordable. No less significant justification for trying to increase vegetable productivity in Nigeria is the potential to generate high income for small producers and additional employment for landless workers and for those involved in food processing.',
      '<h3>The Benefits of Vegetable Farming</h3>',
      "a). Consuming more fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the most important things you can do to stay healthy. When you pick vegetables right from your garden, the vitamin content will be at its highest. Also, you are reducing the risk of eating vegetables that contain harmful chemicals–you know exactly what you're eating!",
      'b). Save money on groceries. One of the benefits of enjoying garden vegetables is a reduced monthly food bill. You can grow organic vegetables for a fraction of the cost in the stores.',
      'c). Get outdoor exercise. Gardening is a physical activity and pulling weeds, planting, and digging can burn up to 400 calories per hour. Gardening is also a good mental exercise and helps keep your mind sharp.',
      'd). Gardening is a natural stress reliever. Being outside in the fresh air and sunshine can improve mood and make you feel rejuvenated and overall happy. Growing your own produce also gives you a great sense of accomplishment.',

    title: 'SILICON VALLEY FOR AFRICA’S AGRICULTURAL START-UPS',
    img: silicon,
    content: [
      'The agricultural and food sector holds the potential to become the driving force behind Africa’s economic development. In order to harness this potential, innovations are needed that can kick-start production and productivity in the agricultural sector, multiply value added and thus generate both jobs and income. In Africa, it is digital innovations in particular that drive agriculture, which is currently still often performed at subsistence level. Despite steadily growing venture capital investments in the continent, start-ups frequently lack capital in their early stages of development. However, this is an important basic prerequisite for taking businesses and innovations to scale. Acquiring sufficient capital is difficult for many young start-ups, with 80 per cent of them already failing after the launch of their first product.',
      'It is in this potential “valley of death” where the project “Scaling digital agriculture innovations through start-ups” (SAIS) sets in. With tailored company development measures implemented by international venture builders, the investment readiness of the start-ups – i.e. their capacity to understand and meet the specific needs and expectations of investors – is improved. This raises the prospects of success for the start-ups being able to obtain the capital needed for scaling or to tap further markets with the aid of new business partners. Here, SAIS adapts processes of existing innovation systems and appropriately applies them to the African context.',
      'By supporting a targeted 30+ start-ups, digital innovations are to directly reach the true target group of the project, the rural population linked to agriculture and food value chains. By the end of the project period, at least 100,000 additional users are to have been gained and earned more income. In this manner, SAIS contributes to Sustainable Development Goals (1) reducing poverty, (2) combating hunger, (8) decent employment and economic growth and (9) industry, innovation and infrastructur.',
      'The project comprises three action areas and covers a term of five years (2019–2023). The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has commissioned Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to implement SAIS.',
      'Crossing the valley of death in three steps',
      '- Step 1: Choosing start-ups: The initial step is to identify, assess and select start-ups in Africa. The start-ups are chosen according to a catalogue of criteria in a selection process comprising several phases. Start-ups are eligible if they are in the post-seed or second stage: they have already successfully set up a business, introduced a digital innovation on the market and attracted their first customers. In addition, with regard to the size of the market and the target group, they have to bear a high scaling potential and generate a positive income effect among their users. In its second year of implementation, SAIS has already recorded more than 250 applications from founders, representing a plus of just below 20 per cent, which speaks for a good standing of the project in Africa’s start-up ecosystem.',
      '- Step 2: Investment Readiness Programme: In the second step, which forms the core of SAIS, the start-ups join a nine-month Investment Readiness Programme (IRP) with tailored business development measures.',
      'First of all, needs assessments of the individual start-ups are made. Their potential for optimisation is defined, and individual development plans are drawn up with the founders. Building on this, the start-ups are then provided with advice on the further development of their business. Here, depending on respective needs, topics such as strategic development, specifying the business model, improving marketing, finance management, acquisition of new groups of customers or technology consulting are addressed. In addition, the pitch decks – brief presentations of the start-ups for potential investors – are optimised, customs in communicating with investors are imparted, and basic aspects of business appraisal are explained. In 2021, 16 start-ups are being supported in this manner.',
      '- Step 3: Networking: The third step involves networking the start-ups with potential business partners and investors. In order to better integrate the selected start-ups in their local ecosystems before and during company development, SAIS is working with a network of local innovation hubs.',
      'This network forms an important basis for the recruitment of investors and the formation of strategic partnerships. These may be both financiers such as business angels, venture capital funds or impact investors and business partners or development cooperation projects. Initial contacts are already established during the company development phase. In a check-in after the first half of the programme, the start-ups are acquainted with potential investors and business partners and informed about further financing options. On the Demo-Day at the end of the IRP, the contacts with investors and potential business partners are intensified with the aim of establishing concrete partnerships and business relationships. Especially promising start-ups can join the SAIS Masterclass, which addresses matchmaking with potential investors and partners in detail.',
      'Outlook',
      'The SAIS project has established itself as an important partner for Ag- and FoodTech start-ups in African ecosystems. Africa’s start-up landscape is clearly heading for growth.',
      'Young people are seeking solutions to existing challenges with technology, with the desire to contribute to the continent’s economic development. Despite strong growth in the AgTech sector, many developments are still in their infancy. In particular, available investment in the field of venture capital is still at a comparatively low level, complicating scaling for start-ups with good ideas and good teams. Less than one per cent of venture capital world-wide (at approximately 220 billion US dollars in 2019) is currently invested in Africa.',
      'While investments roughly double from year to year, they are still too low for the challenges and opportunities which the continent faces, leaving valuable potential lying fallow. SAIS seeks to generate additional capital options for African start-ups through matchmaking and to also make the market attractive for investors from Germany and Europe. Here, the SAIS team have opted for various channels such as business clubs, investor data banks and contacts they have established themselves as well as renowned foundations.Despite existing challenges such as the “valley of death”, a paucity of investment and the corona pandemic, African start-ups and SAIS are optimistic about the future.',
      'This is why SAIS has started to focus also on the Francophone region, where it seeks to raise start-up potentials and offer tailored support measures for start-ups in the programme. Furthermore, SAIS will extend its efforts in the promotion of female founders with awards tailored to female-led start-ups and increased attention on network building for female founders throughout the programme.',
      'SAIS start-ups in the corona crisis',
      'The corona pandemic is causing considerable problems for African agriculture since central markets have shut down and travelling to the commercial centres is hardly possible. As a consequence, farmers are losing income, while food supplies for the population are becoming tight.',
      'Some of the African start-ups supported by SAIS are addressing these challenges with digital solutions. With the aid of the Ugandan platform Bringo Fresh, farmers can sell their goods in spite of restrictions. Customers need not go to the markets but can order food directly via the app. Orders are freshly packed and immediately delivered by moped. During the corona crisis, Bringo Fresh has succeeded in more than doubling its turnover compared to the previous year. In contrast, the Zambian company eMsika is a virtual marketplace for agricultural input. Seed, fertiliser and state-of-the-art technologies such as solar-powered water pumps can be ordered online and delivered to remote areas. Around 2,100 Zambian farmers are being provided with input by eMsika.',
      'Both start-ups are already planning their next steps. Bringo Fresh is working on its expansion to Kenya, and eMsika is developing an online academy in which farmers are trained in improved cultivation methods.',
      '<b>Start-up application areas suitable for support:</b>',
      '1. E-Commerce for farmers (e. g. selling produce, inputs)',
      '2. Information & consulting services (know-how, consulting, weather data)',
      '3. Fintech for farmers (financing, credit services, crowd funding)',
      '4. Farm supply chain management (farm management, transport, warehousing)',
      '5. New technologies (Internet of things, artificial intelligence, etc.)',
